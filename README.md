# tortoise-twitter
## Introduction
This project provides an rss feed for a user's list of twitter handles supplied, allowing an rss user to take their twitter content once per day and mitigate the attention competition inherent in Twitter's UI
### Slow and Steady Wins The Race!

## Installation
Included Docker compose file is by far the easiest way to get started, for those familiar with docker.  Do take care to keep the MongoURI environment variable pointing to whatever your mongo server is named in any case.

## Further Setup
The application will provide you a customized RSS URL to feed to your favorite RSS Reader.

## Feature Expansion
New features coming over time.  Suggestions are welcome, though app focus will remain on simplifying Twitter exposure, allowing the user to follow less talkative handles in a way that won't be drowned out by the day's highest volume topics.
